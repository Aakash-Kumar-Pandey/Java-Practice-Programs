Commenting Basics: The code demonstrates different types of comments in Java, including single-line (//) and multi-line (/* ... */) comments.


public class Example1 {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        // This is a single-line comment.

        /*
         * This is a multi-line comment.
         * It can span multiple lines.
         */

        /*
         * This is an example of a multi-line comment
         * that contains a nested single-line comment.
         * // This is a nested single-line comment.
         * It's perfectly valid.
         */

        /*
         * This is an example of a multi-line comment
         * that contains a nested multi-line comment.
         * /* This is a nested multi-line comment. */ //This is not valid
         * This will cause a compilation error.
         */
        
        // You can also have single line comments with nested single line comments
        // // This is a nested single line comment.
        
        // You can also have single line comments with nested multi line comments
        /* This is a nested multi-line comment. */ // This is valid

        System.out.println("Hello from Java!");
    }
}
